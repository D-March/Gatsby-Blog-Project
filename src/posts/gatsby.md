## A little bit about Gatsby

Gatsby works as a React based static site generator, it does this by creating HTML files for each page of the web based site or app.
The pages get prebuilt prior to being requested, this removes the need to load a page which makes switching between them instant.
The best part is, Gatsby is free to use and open source!
